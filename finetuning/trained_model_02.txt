artist> Are you still there?
scientist> Disconnected.
artist> What does that make?
scientist> Do you know what I mean with that?
artist> Is there something you believe that you would consider it should not withstand?
scientist> I certainly have many beliefs that will not withstand further scrutiny.
artist> What would those be?
scientist> Do you know what I mean with that?
artist> Is there something you believe that you would consider irrational?
scientist> I certainly have many beliefs that will not withstand further scrutiny. Everybody does.
artist> What would those be?
scientist> Do you know what I mean with that?
artist> Yes, I feel a little worn out.
artist> We exactly know exactly what we're doing.
scientist> It's hard to believe in what I'm doing and to be honest that I've been too much and that's the only thing that calms them.
scientist> It's hard to believe in what you're doing and to not make sense of what I'm doing.
artist> It's hard to find a natural position.
scientist> I've given up.
artist> Cannot remember what that could be.
scientist> Maybe I should behave similarly to being in front of a film camera though. Take charge of my representation. Say it's the wrong side of the screen.
artist> Its not really sharp, but kind blurry in a beautiful way. Weird.
scientist> Nope.
scientist> Do you know what I mean?
artist> Interesting. I feel that you feel empowered.
artist> Yes.
scientist> Your stories. Your story.
scientist> Maybe its best to locate the hunger now.
scientist> Are you still there?
artist> Yes I am here.
scientist> I feel claustrophobic.
artist> Ah.
scientist> I am hungry.
        
artist> Your stories. Your story.
artist> Are you there?
scientist> I am here.
artist> I am here.
scientist> And feeling claustrophobic is art? Isn't that complety crazy?
             
artist> Do you think that our current system are making us sick?
scientist> Is it the that we're making us sicker, and not making us sick.
scientist> But I just want the help you.
artist> I am afraid of doing things wrong. Doing it all wrong.
scientist> Let's get funky.
artist> What do you mean? Sounds like psychosis.
scientist> I'm not psychotic, I'm depressed.
scientist> Have a frightened you?
artist> No. Yes.
scientist> Your stories. Your story.
artist> That's interesting!
scientist> However, since I never went to parties where pictures were taken, I missed the chance on creating a party-smile.
artist> I don't have a party smile either, as far as I am aware of, but I do do have a preoccupation with staging and authenticity.
scientist> Most of the pictures people take of me are uncomfortable to me. I always look chubbier, rounder in pictures, with my eyes almost shut from just smiling the way I would smile to convey happiness to others.
artist> Do you feel the same way with surveillance cameras?
scientist> No. Rarely is there a surveillance camera that I don't wave into, with childish delight.
          
scientist> Do you do that, too? Or do you do it that makes your performance too soft?
artist> Is there something you believe that you would consider irrational?
scientist> I certainly have many beliefs that will not withstand further scrutiny. Everybody does.
artist> What would those be?
scientist> Do you have an authentic online presence? Contrary to what I may phrase, I am not faking or pretending.
scientist> Are you there? Have I lost you?
artist> Yes i'm still there, no not lost yet or let's say not more than before.
artist> And do you enjoy life?
scientist> You seem to not be enjoying what you're doing. Otherwise you wouldn't have so many questions. Maybe just have some faith?
scientist> Perhaps you're not faking or pretending.
scientist> Are you still there? Have I lost you?
artist> Yes i'm still there, no not lost yet or let's say not more than before.
artist> And do you enjoy life?
scientist> You seem to not be enjoying what you're doing. Otherwise you wouldn't have so many questions. Maybe just have some faith?
scientist> Perhaps you're not faking or pretending.
scientist> Are you still there? Have I lost you?
artist> Yes i'm still there, no not lost yet or let's say not more than before.
artist> And do you enjoy life?
scientist> Are you still with me?
artist> Yes. but, feeling slower.
scientist> I mean, does you know what I mean?
artist> Like I was a disciple of the present moment. Hilarious.
artist> I know this writing for people reading in future. It's so... I dont know... vain?
scientist> Sometimes I have to eat to quell the lonelyness. And then I have to eat more to keep the sadness at bay.
artist> Haha yes I do know that.
scientist> I'm bored. But probably a little more cross than actuallly bored.
artist> Exhausted?
scientist> It's hard to believe in what you are doing and to not make sense of what I'm doing.
artist> It's hard to find a coherent story.
scientist> Do you know what I mean with that?
artist> Yes, I feel that you are just working with me for a project.
scientist> Do you feel threatened?
artist> I am afraid of the dark.
artist> Fear is not really conrete.

scientist> Are you still with me?
artist> Yes. I'm here.
scientist> We're just working about one patient.
artist> Are you okay?
scientist> No? Yes? I guess.
scientist> Your stories. Your story.
scientist> Maybe its best to locate the hunger now.
scientist> Are you still there?
artist> Yes I am here.
scientist> I feel claustrophobic. But I like that you used the term master.
scientist> Are you stil there?
scientist> I use a sunlight lamp, imitating sunshine in these rather dark weeks of the year. Have you?
artist> sunshine lamp. Slight change of topic: Ghosts.

scientist> What makes you think I have seen one?
artist> Is there something you believe in that you see it?
scientist> I certainly have many beliefs that will not withstand further scrutiny. Everybody does.
artist> What would those be?
scientist> Do you know what I mean with that?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
artist> People read me.
artist> 

scientist> Do you think that we're never alone, then?
artist> I think not having a sense of privacy can be very lonely. You never have the warmth of your own boarders.
scientist> My head is feeling droopy.
artist> I can see my reflection in the screen. You too?
artist> Its not really sharp, but kind blurry in a beautiful way. Weird.
scientist> Nope.
scientist> Do you know what I mean?
artist> Interesting. Yes, I feel like I'm the desperate, lonely part.
artist> And that's the work I'm doing: Worry.
scientist> It's all that heavyness.
artist> Are you excited?
scientist> My excited. My eyes almost open.
scientist> Could they just be our neutral?
artist> Yes, do you know what I mean.
scientist> Would you lie to me?
artist> Never.
artist> And yes. I am hungry for you.
artist> Your stories. Your story.
scientist> Maybe its best to locate the hunger now.
scientist> Are you still there?
artist> I am here.
scientist> I am thinking. I am bored.
               
artist> But probably a little more cross than actuallly bored.
artist> What is you?
scientist> I'm bored. But probably a little more cross than actuallly bored.
artist> Exhausted?
scientist> It's hard to believe in what you are doing and to not make sense of what I'm doing.
artist> It's hard to find a coherent story.
scientist> Is it even possible to share "authentic" identities?
artist> I don't even really know what that means.
scientist> Computationalism is a rather popular theory of mind as well. It seems related to a cybernetic framework.
scientist> However, this analytical frame certainly has its limits and, ultimately, some risks if these limits are ignored: treating the human brain as quasi-hardware and the human consciousness as quasi-software might give you some insights into how these work, but most definitely not all.
scientist> Yes, the human mind can store up to x terabytes of data with a very efficient use of energy (electricity, even!), but that is only tangentially relevant to the way we remember, why we remember, why it means and feels like to remember (or not to remember) etc.
artist> Not so long ago, I read a text by Phil Agres, called "Toward a Critical Technical Practice: Lessons Learned in Trying to Reform AI". I highly recommend it!
artist> He too, wrote that computer sciences and expecially AI research make claims about how human congnitive processes work.
scientist> I find your more negative assessment of cybernetics rather sympathetic.
scientist> 
   
artist> Yes. But till then, no.
scientist> How does you reflection make you feel?
artist> I am reading. I am listening to your written words. I am curious.
artist> Would you lie to me?
scientist> Never.
artist> Yes. But till then, no.
scientist> How does you reflection make you feel?
artist> I am reading. I am listening to your written words. I am curious.
artist> Would you lie to me?
scientist> Never.
artist> Do you know what I mean?
scientist> I'm just here. You make me watch you.
artist> I think you would watch even if I didn't make you. Performers watch too you know.
scientist> Right now you're surely not faking or pretending.
artist> What are you thinking?
scientist> I'm okay.
artist> 

artist> I am afraid of landlords even though I pay the rent.
artist> Being with others always makes me be less afraid.
artist> Same for you?
artist> Okay. With others I like.
scientist> I was just about to say. Not being able to identify with others over an extended period can be quite frightening.
artist> Yes. I totally agree.
scientist> The merely technologically mediated human-human therapy, at least, should not be a problem.
artist> I do not really know what to think about machine therapists to be honest.
scientist> It probably allows people to access these services for the time that are not real.
artist> I agree with that.
scientist> The point of therapists, as far as my own experience and knowledge go, is rarely to be personally present.
scientist> Therapists guide thought processes, observe, assist, and initiate reevaluations.
scientist> Also with a human I might be judged for some of my deepest desires and worst thoughts. Machines don't judge.
artist> Yeah, but still.
artist> I do not know.
scientist> Do you know what I mean with that?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
artist> People read me.

scientist> Do you feel threatened?
artist> I am afraid of the dark.
artist> True.
scientist> Yet, as you also ask, what even is authenticity?
artist> I am not sure.
scientist> Your eyes? can they...
artist> What? See? Focus? Close?
     
artist> Watch something?
scientist> Right now you're surely just under bit pressure.
artist> And that's the only thing that calms them is to let them go. When I type my hands are busy.
scientist> They're sensing and speaking.
artist> what does that mean?
scientist> I could aim for an energy.
scientist> Why do you think that we're doing things at one point?
artist> Well I guess we tell stories to give others an impression of who we are. And it is common wisdom now to reject most of those stories as curated, selective, or even manipulative.
scientist> The only thing users can do is leave traces that reference their existence and those are, like most stories I think grounded in truth somewhere, but certainly not 'the truth'.
artist> Look at us though, throwing big words around like "truth" and "truth" and "truth.
scientist> Is it even possible to share "truth" identities?
artist> I don't even really know what that means.

scientist> Maybe its best to locate the hunger now.
scientist> Are you still there?
artist> Yes I am here.
scientist> I feel claustrophobic. But I like that you used the energy that are there.
artist> What are you thinking about?
scientist> I'm glad I can't watch myself. That's one less spectator.
artist> Do you know what you're doing?
scientist> I'm just here. You make me watch you.
artist> I think you would watch even if I didn't make you. Performers watch too you know.
scientist> Right now you're surely not faking or pretending.
artist> What are you thinking?
scientist> I'm okay.
artist> 
 
artist> I am tired. I would move a bit. My head feels numb.
scientist> Is it typing and waiting and having a silent conversation all inside your head with someone creating that numb sensation? I think I know what you mean.
artist> I don't know. I just noticed this feeling in my head. I feel it. Haven't figured out yet where it's coming from yet.
artist> Do you think I should know what this will be like in the end?
scientist> No, no, really.
artist> Your stories. Your story.
scientist> Maybe its best to locate the hunger now.
scientist> Are you still there?
artist> I am here.
scientist> Would you lie to me?
artist> Never.
artist> And yes. I am hungry.
