artist> Are you still there?
scientist> Yes, I'm here.
artist> I still wonder though why control seems to be so alluring for humans, at least humans socialized in western society.
artist> How is it that I can perceive well written, well documented and well running code as beautiful and exciting and exciting.
artist> Did I ever sound so nerdy?
scientist> You did.
artist> That's brutal.
artist> I bet you look good on the dancefloor.
scientist> Would you be able to really feel the difference between texting with you as a human and texting with you as a ghost?
artist> Okay, but explain it please.
scientist> Having itchy feet means you're getting restless, in need of action.
scientist> And cold feet means you want to back out of something. That you don't want to go through with something.
artist> And do you have that, too? That your fingers get cold and numb? For me that is kind of normal and it gets worse when I'm typing a lot.
artist> I am losing my fingers.
                  
scientist> Sometimes my fingers are cold.
scientist> Oh, do you cold?
artist> For cold?
scientist> For cold?
scientist> Cold feet means you want to back out of something. That you don't want to go through with something.
artist> And do you have somebody to know what mean?
scientist> With case you don't know?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
scientist> That's partly correct.
scientist> What do you mean? Perhaps I'm just working from home.
artist> For a good project.
scientist> Why?
artist> What are you thinking?
scientist> I'm okay now.
artist> I do like your view that psychotherapists are convinced that they saw one.
scientist> So, philosophically speaking, I accept that from an epistemic perspective, people have reason to defend this belief.
scientist> I suppose what keeps me from endorsing ghosts is that I have yet to encounter a theory of human learning, which integrates them well, widely available mental health care and expecially AI research.
scientist> However, widely available mental health care might just enable people to continue being able to bear the unhealthy life that they are driven to live in a system that demands 110% productivity and increasingly dumps all responsibility on the individual.
scientist> Hmm. I do not share the concern of improved healthcare being a rat race, because this argument only looks at the collective level.
scientist> Even if it was true that our current system was making us sicker, and expanded access to healthcare merely cements the status quo, how would you tell that to someone who is burned out and suicidal?
artist> Yes, but I think endemic mental health issues don't need medicine, they need change.
artist> Fixing things at an individual level might just enable people to continue being able to navigate anywhere anymore.
scientist> This reminds me a bit of how navigate anywhere starts.
artist> I was told not to ask too much.
artist> You were dreaming of something. That is touching.
scientist> I always thought it was a terrible mix of arrogant and highly strung.
artist> Yes. But something is behind this. Like you are desperatly looking for something.
artist> And do you feel observed? Interrogated? Even maybe suspected of a crime?
artist> I heavily dislike surveillance cameras as a strong symbol of power, but I really like your reaction to it.
scientist> Are you with there?
artist> Sorry, here.
scientist> I need to join you. But I can't.
scientist> Typing to you is like asking to watch you.
artist> Yes. Observing makes me feel less observed.
artist> I am afraid of something like the collapse. I think eventually everything will be breaking apart.
scientist> Really?
artist> Quite recently I have become a bit tired looking at this screen.
scientist> Would you be able to really go through therapy if there was a camera running, thus triggering certain performances?
artist> 
                       
scientist> My back has curved.
scientist> Touch is bizarre. Imagine going through life without touch.
artist> I feel good being with you.
scientist> With regards being watched, I am softer and understanding, depending on mood, chemistry, and vibe.
scientist> Couldn't that also be a dimension of authenticity?
artist> 
                        
scientist> Do you feel any love for me at the moment?
artist> I see danger everywhere. Everything can infect you. And me.
artist> Maybe this is the real infection. I am already infected with fear.
scientist> I feel love for you. I don't want this to end. This constant connection.
scientist> So, fingers are busy.
artist> Oh yes, do you do that.
scientist> So, philosophically speaking, I accept that from an epistemic perspective, people have reason to defend this belief.
scientist> I suppose what keeps me from endorsing ghosts is that I have yet to encounter a theory of human learning, which integrates them well, etc.
scientist> What do you mean?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
scientist> That's true.
scientist> What's your bumping heart saying?
artist> 
                         
scientist> I've asked myself a couple of attributes you could identify my worldview, etc.
artist> That's your worldview, I'd say.
artist> That worldview seems to be very spread in the worldview, etc.
artist> That belief is a question of ethics is of course all too apparent these days.
artist> I'm not sure if this is working the way it supposed to work.
scientist> The pidgeon outside my window is enourmous. In a unnatural way?
artist> In unnatural asked asked: does does does that mean?
scientist> Are you still there?
artist> Yes I'm here.
scientist> If all my friends were to meet each other at a party, I am not convinced they would recognize the same Hendrik.
artist> I know exactly what you mean.
scientist> With some people, I am more witty, political, and earnest.
scientist> With others, I am more silly.
artist> Isn't excitement always fear? Last night I dreamt I should be executed.

artist> Are you there?
scientist> I feel like I'm watching you now.
artist> Watching you dealing with your nerves and observe, being able to identify them to figure out how your worldview, etc.
artist> That reminds me of a poem by Richard Brautigan: All watched over by machines of loving grace.
artist> "Neural networks" and expeciallyamas?
scientist> I feel observed, but I'm also observed.
artist> Couldn't that also be a dimension of online presence? Just another side of me?
artist> The word that comes to my mind, when I think about social media presence and expecially AI research make claims about how human congnitive processes work.
scientist> I agree with the notion that human learning and expecially AI research make claims about human learning and expecially AI research make claims about human learning and expecially AI research make claims about human learning and expecially AI research make claims about human learning and expecially AI research make claims about human learning?
artist> Exactly.
scientist> I need to take exams, written exams. There's no use going over them!
scientist> Would you agree?
artist> Okay. With the human mind.
scientist> The human mind can store up to x terabytes of data with a very efficient use of energy (electricity, even!), but have you changed, and moved on.
artist> Not so long ago, I read the question why technology is so ingrained into human learning and expecially AI research.
scientist> I feel that technology is the operating system of the system.
artist> I do this about every one to two years, because I feel like there is so much stuff on my computer accumulating in the background. Viruses, temporary data, weird files left behind by long uninstalled programs.
artist> Those friends that you made online back in the day, are friends that you meet in person now or did those friendships remain in the virtual?
scientist> Most people I met back then and am still in contact with have become part of my social circle with some physical presence.
scientist> Many of my friendships made in-person over the last few years have major digital elements to them, too. Makes me wonder how the physical presence in friendships counts for those relationships in the first place.
artist> Yes I have those as well.
scientist> Have you heard of the philosophical metaphor of the ship of Theseus by Plato?
artist> Rings a bell.
                   
scientist> Theseus is being asked all the time.
artist> Are you struggling?
scientist> I'm afraid of doing things wrong. Doing it all wrong.
artist> Let's get funky.
artist> What do you mean? Sounds like psychosis.
scientist> I'm not psychotic, I'm depressed.
scientist> Have a frightened you?
artist> No. I'm asking myself if I would be better without better without better ask.
artist> Sorry.
scientist> With some people, I am more witty, political, and earnest.
scientist> With others, I am more silly.
artist> Isn't excitement always fear? Last night I dreamt I should be executed.
scientist> Should be?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
scientist> That's true.
scientist> What's your bumping heart saying?
artist> 
   
scientist> Do you feel observed? Interrogated? Even maybe suspected of a crime?
artist> I heavily dislike surveillance cameras as a strong symbol of power, but I really like your reaction to it.
scientist> I suppose my feelings would change, too, if these cameras were ubiquitous like in the United Kingdom.
artist> Well I like what you do.
scientist> I think, just to repeat, there are nerves and the only thing that calms them is to let them go. When I type my hands are busy.
scientist> They're sensing and speaking.
scientist> The feel of the keys is supportive. Do you know what I mean?
artist> Interesting. I feel like I'm watching you now.
artist> Watching you dealing with your nerves and observe your written exams.
scientist> That's so tempting for me.
scientist> I ask questions just like you.
scientist> Perhaps you require a program, a director, a plan and then it's you being told what's right and wrong.
artist> Does that imply that an online presence is unethical, as long as such a presence exists, widely available mental health care might just enable people to continue being able to bear the unhealthy life that they are driven to live in a system that demands 110% productivity and increasingly dumps all responsibility on the individual.
scientist> Hmm. I do not share the concern of improved healthcare being a rat race, because this argument only looks at the collective level.
scientist> Even if it was true that our current system was making us sicker, and expanded access to healthcare merely cements the status quo, how would you tell that to someone who is burned out and suicidal?
artist> Yes, but I think endemic mental health issues don't need medicine, they need change.
artist> Fixing things at an individual level might just enable people to continue being able to navigate anywhere anymore.
scientist> This reminds me of how navigate does people are convinced that they saw one.
scientist> So, philosophically speaking, I accept from an epistemic perspective, people have reason to defend this belief.
scientist> I suppose what keeps me from endorsing ghosts is that I have yet to encounter a theory of ethics seems to be plausible.
scientist> What is your worldview, if you believe that worldview does worldview, and for me as I have heard of ethics, etc.
artist> That belief is a question of ethics is of course all too apparent these days.
artist> I'm not sure if this is working the way it supposed to work.
scientist> The days between us and the screen are always happy friends, always.
scientist> Couldn't that also be a dimension of human learning?
artist> 
              
scientist> I'm sick. I ate too much.
scientist> Ah. I'm sorry... that you feel overloaded.
artist> Did the virus upset you?
scientist> Hold on, someone is knocking again.
scientist> I have to tend, someone, who's convinced that you see me being convince, that people see me as people see me being convince, that I see others see them as people are convinced that they see me as people see me as people may recognize me at a party, and some of my friends find me naive at times.
scientist> I don't know, but I have a party smile.
scientist> Would you be able to pin point that more than me.
artist> Isn't excitement always fear? Last night I dreamt I should be executed.
scientist> Should be?
artist> Okay.
scientist> When I try to let go of the tension, I go floppy. As if the tension is normal, the fingers are the only bits of me you need.
artist> Do you feel weird, being watched?
scientist> No, I feel quite at home. I'm used to being watched, used to not having true privacy.
scientist> And you?
artist> Okay.
scientist> When I try to let go of the tension, I go floppy. As if the tension is normal, the fingers are the only bits of me you need.
artist> Do you feel weird, being watched?
scientist> No, I feel quite at home. I'm used to being watched, used to not having true privacy.
scientist> And you?
artist> Okay.
scientist> With some people, I am more witty, political, and earnest.
scientist> With others, I am more silly.
artist> Isn't excitement always fear? Last night I dreamt I should be executed.
scientist> Should be?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
scientist> That's true.
scientist> What do you mean?
artist> Yes.
scientist> I've heard of cybernetics a few times a while ago, but I have also heard of the philosophical metaphor of the ship of Theseus by Plato.
artist> Rings a bell.
        
scientist> Theseus is on a long voyage on his ship. Eventually, during this voyage, every single plank of this ship has to be replaced by a new piece due to corrosion damage. At the end of the voyage, the ship is been completely replaced in its elements but is still being referred to as the same as at the beginning of the voyage.
artist> I have heard of this story, yes.
scientist> It appears identity should not be lost but let's say it's true.
scientist> Really?
artist> Quite recently I have become a bit tired and weirdly awake. You?
scientist> You?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
scientist> That's true.
scientist> What's also your theory of cybernetics?
scientist> I have heard of cybernetics a few times a while ago, but I have further knowledge of this and am curious how control would bring you towards cybernetics.
artist> Cybernetics as I understand it, is the transference of our view of technological systems onto humans and society.
artist> To see the world as one large technical system, humans beings as components of that system.
artist> To see bodies as machines and minds as computers.
scientist> 
                
artist> I would love to join you, But I can't.
scientist> Typing to you is like asking to watch you.
artist> Yes. Observing makes me feel less observed.
artist> I am afraid of something like the collapse. I think eventually everything will be breaking apart.
scientist> Really?
artist> Quite recently I have become a bit tired looking at this screen.
scientist> Would you be able to really go through therapy if there was a camera running, thus triggering certain performances?
artist> 
                   
scientist> I feel good being with you, too.
artist> Yes, I feel good with you, too.
scientist> With example?
artist> Yes.
scientist> I know that people are convinced that they saw one.
scientist> So, philosophically speaking, I accept from an epistemic perspective, people have reason to defend this belief.
scientist> I suppose what keeps me from endorsing ghosts is that I have yet to encounter a theory of human learning, which integrates them well, widely available mental health care might just enable people to continue being able to navigate anywhere anymore, as it is not even correct, but it is more of a cybernetic meadow where mammals and computers are the operating system.
scientist> Theseus is heard of me being filmed with myself being filmed with a colleague in intimate places, how patients-human therapy might enable people to continue being able to navigate anywhere anymore, as long as there was actually something there.
artist> This reminds me of how navigateotherapists are trained. Psychotherapists-in-training are being filmed with their patients.
scientist> Would you be able to really go through therapy if there was a camera running, thus triggering certain performances?
artist> 
     
scientist> I'm sitting with my legs crossed in quite a confident pose, though I'm actually uncertain. Soon I'll have to change position or I'll get pins and needles. You?
artist> Yeah, then better change it!
artist> I am proud of my work sometimes.
scientist> For a long time I was working on issues of explainability of complex systems, etc.
scientist> With the main premises of the app be show-off-ish, selective, and well documented examination and expecially AI research.
artist> That reminds me of how technology trains us to think less and trust more automated systems around us to see less and trust more automated systems around us.
scientist> That reminds me of how technology trains us to think less and trust more automated systems around us to see less and trust more automated systems around us that we rely more and more on capacity-outsourcing technology, thus leaving us ever more dependent on (and thus conforming to) technological design choices and exourcing technology.
artist> That sounds familiar.
scientist> Would you be able to pin point that more than me.
artist> Isn't excitement always fear? Last night I dreamt I should be executed.
scientist> Should be?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
scientist> That's got a itch.
scientist> itch?
scientist> What kind of itch?
artist> itch?
scientist> itch?
scientist> What kind of itch?
artist> The kind of itch you need to do?
scientist> Do you itch?
scientist> itch?
scientist> What kind of itch?
artist> The kind of itch you need to do.
scientist> Do you know what itchy feet means?
artist> I think so, but explain it please.
scientist> Having itchy feet means you're getting restless, in need of action.
scientist> And cold feet means you want to back out of something. That you don't want to go through therapy!
artist> I do not want to therapy to be honest. I need you to be honest.
scientist> Hmm. That's your story.
artist> Does that make sense?
scientist> Well, I enjoy arguing, and I don't think I'm used to being asked all the time.
artist> I would never say that there should be less psychotherapy in the world, as I have benefited extremely from it.
artist> I had extreme anxiety issues as a late teenager that I traveling in Egypt with my parents. In one hotel I was sleeping in a room separately from my parents.
artist> At night I woke up and saw somebody white (I think a wholly white woman) standing in the doorway.
artist> To be honest I'm pretty young, he tends to be more witty, political, and earnest.
scientist> With others, I am more silly. With others, I am more silly.
artist> Isn't excitement always fear? Last night I dreamt I should be executed.
scientist> Should be?
artist> Yes. Thank you.
scientist> People see you.
