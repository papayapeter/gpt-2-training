scientist> Are you still with me?
artist> Yes, I'm here.
scientist> I still wonder though why control seems to be so alluring for humans, at least humans socialized in western society.
artist> How is it that I can perceive well written, well documented and well running code as beautiful and exciting.
artist> Did I ever sound so nerdy?
scientist> You did.
artist> I think I have seen you.
scientist> Have you?
artist> I'm not that present. My phone was just vibrating. Told me, I'm still here.
scientist> Do you use your thumbs while typing?
artist> I need to type something to figure out, yes. but not that often. You?
scientist> This is hard so far. Writing to my words. I need to type something to figure out, yes. but not that often. You?
scientist> This is hard so often. Writing to me.
scientist> Am I forcing this?
scientist> Hello? You with me?
artist> Sorry, here. Still. Don't know what to do.
scientist> Some kind of forget.
scientist> And then I'd come to the now and realise I've read the same page multiple times.
artist> That is touching.
scientist> Are you here?
artist> Here? I think so.
scientist> I hope you're still there.
artist> Yes I am here.

artist> How is it that I can perceive well written, well documented and well running code as beautiful and exciting.
artist> Did I ever sound so nerdy?
scientist> You did.
artist> Yes. Observing makes me feel less observed.
artist> I am afraid of something like the collapse. I think eventually everything will be breaking apart.
scientist> Really?
artist> Yes.
scientist> I'm hungry.
             
artist> Are you there?
scientist> I don't know.
artist> What do you think?
scientist> I more and more believe that we construct identity mostly through stories (or history). This can be empowering in some cases but restricting in others.
scientist> You have a point. Any approach to a theory of identity should answer more questions than what Plato does.
artist> I could claim my history and construct my story, but I can also be seen as the stories that are being told about me or, even worse, see myself this way. Does that make sense?
scientist> I suppose. Especially with personal identity, our own perceptions and self-narratives and stories are the more relevant pieces that make for what we call a self.
artist> On social networks, you construct identity through stories also.
scientist> True, but I never figured out how to tell a coherent story about myself online, even though I mentioned me being a philosopher in one or two Instagram posts, which I suppose is partly correct, but also to report, show-off-ish, and not to say that I have seen myself this way.
artist> What is your story (or one of them anyway)?
scientist> Come to think of it, I might have been most coherent on online-dating profiles.
scientist> I wonder how we in the end create our own identity online.
artist> I think it is rather impossible to have an 'authentic' online presence. Contrary to how we may phrase it, one cannot be online, right?
artist> 
        
scientist> What do you think?
artist> I have never used a sunshine lamp. I do consume large parts of the world.
scientist> Slight change of who controls, control is not lost but redistributed) and in the end I just have to consume large parts of the consume.
artist> I am sorry for being so callous.
artist> Your points make a lot of sense and what you wrote shows me that I have been wrong in my perspective or at least very short sighted.
scientist> Well I enjoy arguing, and I don't think you were particularly arguing.
artist> I would never say that there should be less psychotherapy in the world, as I have benefited extremely from it.
artist> I had extreme anxiety issues as a late teenager that almost prevented me from leaving the house for a year or so.
scientist> Oh. How are you doing now?
artist> My eye lids open and close slowly at the moment.
scientist> I can feel every blink.

artist> I can hear an airplane flying outside.
artist> I was told not to ask too much.
artist> And actually not to ask too much.
artist> I would like to hold you up, keep you supported. What you are doing must be challenging, exhausting.
artist> I don't know. Maybe. For now I'm surprisingly okay with sitting here, staring outside my window and texting with you.
artist> Don't expect much from you or this moment.
scientist> Pressure always plays a role with me.
scientist> Facts are forceful. They change reality.
artist> Everything changes reality.
scientist> Something.
artist> I don't know.
scientist> It's hard to believe in what you are doing and to not to say.
scientist> It's often a question of your surroundings, needing some of my friends to do what you don't want.
scientist> How is it that my fingers can't do that, too? It's sometimes my fingers can't do it. It's sometimes my fingers can't find a natural position.
artist> I have to go to the natural position, as if the natural position is the only natural, as is the natural position.
scientist> Right. My fingers are heavier. And my arms are putting up a fight!
scientist> Maybe my hands want to do something other than typing!
artist> Are you still there?
scientist> Yes, here.

scientist> Really?
artist> Yes.
scientist> Have you ever used a sunshine lamp?
artist> Have you ever used a sunshine lamp?
scientist> I have never used a sunshine lamp. I do consume large quantities of vitamin D in the winter though.
scientist> I am currently working on placebos and their ethical use, which is why I was thinking of this.
