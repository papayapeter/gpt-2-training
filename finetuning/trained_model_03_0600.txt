artist> Are you still there?
scientist> Disconnected but nowhere somewhere to put my energy.
artist> What are your dreams like?
scientist> Recurring. Yours?
artist> Most of those stories I have become a bit afraid of ghosts, am I afraid of ghosts, you?
scientist> I once read that people who believe that their house is haunted or otherwise inhabited by non-worldly beings are often lonely. After all, even if the presence of the unknown is creepy, it's a presence after all.
scientist> Are you lonely?
artist> You are right, I do feel a bit lonely here.
              
artist> In this loneliness my apartment started to feel more present. Kind of like it was alive in a way.
artist> We were never alone, we were never alone.
scientist> And you?
artist> Yes.
scientist> I really have those questions. Maybe I should try to get the faintest sence of privacy.
artist> Do you know what mean?
scientist> Well I'll admit that I have never seen you as a wholly white woman.
artist> wholly white people.
artist> white people?
scientist> Well, I kind a wholly white woman.
artist> I cannot convince anyone that I am not faking or pretending.
scientist> Are you there? Have I lost you?
scientist> 
                  
artist> I'm bored.
scientist> But maybe a little more cross than actuallly bored.
artist> Exhausted?
scientist> I haven'tusted a lot.
artist> I'musted a little stiff. Right.
scientist> My body is passive.
artist> My shoulders are hanging in weird positions.
scientist> Mine too. Mot necessary for the fingers to work.
artist> It's hard to find a natural position.
artist> I've given up.
artist> Cannot remember what that could be.
scientist> Maybe this is the natural position for typing. Something in my body doesn't care anymore.
artist> I can hear my neighbours talk. Seems to be quite a crowd.
artist> If I would just be able to decide.
scientist> 
        
scientist> Are you still there?
artist> What do you think about (ai driven) therapy apps?
scientist> I have heard of cybernetics a few times a while ago, but I have honestly no further knowledge of this and am curious how control would bring you towards cybernetics.
artist> Cybernetics as I understand it, is the transference of our view of technological systems onto humans and society.
artist> To see the world as one large technical system, humans beings as components of that system.
artist> To see bodies as machines and minds as computers.
scientist> 
    
artist> Wow.
scientist> Not always easy to say.
    
scientist> How are you doing?
artist> My thoughts are your thoughts are my thoughts are your thoughts. Maybe we need to talk to other people for a while.
scientist> Do you feel any love for me at the moment?
artist> I see danger everywhere. Everything can infect you. And me.
artist> Maybe this is the real infection. I am already infected with fear.
scientist> I feel love for you. I don't want this to end. This constant connection.
scientist> But I want the pressure, the distance, the anxiety to stop. The feeling that this has to go somewhere.
scientist> Do you know what this will be?
artist> New perspective?
scientist> Does you have any fears or sensations that seem completely irrational? Because claustrophobia is somehow.... very rational.
artist> Losing control.
artist> I mean I get by day by day and I'm always afraid that at one point I just won't make it.
artist> Are you still there?
scientist> Disconnected but nowhere somewhere to put my energy.
artist> What are your dreams like?
scientist> Recurring. Yours?
artist> Most of those stories I have become part of the online presence, though I mentioned me being a philosopher in one or two Instagram posts, which I suppose eventually everything would be philosopher, but I didn't think so back then.
artist> What do you think?
scientist> I more and more believe that we have certain control over what we (sincerely) believe.
scientist> Not everything you believe should be believed, and we would claim that you should try to believe only true statements.
artist> Does that imply that a belief in ghosts is unethical, as long as such a theory, that integrates them well, has been forwarded, selective, and unpredictable.
scientist> I suppose the ethics of believing in ghosts are rather neutral in themselves.
scientist> If you believe in ghosts, you ought to be able to explain what that means for your worldview, and I suppose that will stand in conflict with what you (supposedly) also believe.
artist> That belief is a question of ethics is of course all too apparent these days.
artist> I'm not sure if this is working the way it supposed to work.
artist> Are you still there?
scientist> Disconnected but nowhere somewhere to put my energy.
artist> What are your dreams like?
scientist> Recurring. Yours?
artist> Most of those stories I have become part of the online presence for some of my friendships, even though I mentioned me being a philosopher in one or two Instagram posts, which I suppose is partly correct, but also kind of show-off-ish, and borderline elitist.
artist> What is your bumping heart saying?
artist> 

scientist> I'm not sure if this is going to work.
scientist> The pidgeon outside my window is enourmous.

artist> Cybernetics is scary. I'm a little overwhelmed. You?
artist> I think I should try to explain what that means for me.
artist> Yes, I understand.
scientist> What about you? What if you're writing?
artist> Writing?

scientist> Do you know what this will be?
scientist> No, not if you're patient with the answer.
artist> Are you okay?
scientist> No? Yes? I guess I might get pins and needles.
artist> needles.
artist> True.
scientist> But I didn't think aincible could be a problem.
artist> Says who? Was that me? Telling you?
artist> Were you told not to answer this question?
scientist> Only maybe.

artist> Most of those stories I have never seen a person walking thing, but some kind of apparition nonetheless.
scientist> Please tell me.
artist> I was pretty young, around 12/13 years old and traveling in Egypt with my parents. In one hotel I was sleeping in a room separately from my parents.
artist> At night I woke up and saw somebody white (I wholly white woman) standing in the doorway.
artist> To be honest I'm pretty short sighted, so it might just have been a trick of the light, but I didn't think so back then.
scientist> I don't have any reason to believe in ghosts.
artist> Don't you?
               
scientist> I need to take a shower?
artist> To wake up or to remember?
scientist> And sitting in front of a screen? Is that empowering?
artist> I am still me.
       
artist> I don't feel so connected.
artist> I like being connected.
scientist> Do you know what itchy feet means?
artist> I think so, but explain it please.
scientist> Having itchy feet means you're getting restless, in need of action.
scientist> And cold feet means you want to back out of something. That you don't want to go through with something.
artist> And do you have to go through therapy with a camera?
scientist> Hmm it seem's your absent.
artist> Hey! I'm absent. Are you still there?
scientist> Disconnected but nowhere somewhere to put my energy.
artist> What are your dreams like?
scientist> Recurring. Yours?
artist> Most of those stories I have made a living practice: I trust people more than I should.
scientist> This backfires every now and then when I entrust someone with a secret and some of my friends find me naive at times.
scientist> I would have to go into detail what the difference between trust and ignorance is, as I am no stranger to know that people are, in fact, bad.
artist> Hmm. That this seems like quite the belief as well.
artist> It embarrases me to say, but I have a lot of superstitions.
artist> I do, for example believe somewhat in making wishes when I find and blow away an eyelash.
scientist> Really?
artist> I don't know.
scientist> Maybe you're still there?

artist> Yes and if you're patient with the answer, that you dopples, then I can talk more easily to you.
scientist> Do you feel smarter than other people?
scientist> Only so smart as people percieve or want me to be.
artist> I need to sigh.
    
scientist> Do you feel a sense?
scientist> Only so smart as people percieve or want me to be.
artist> I need to sigh.

scientist> My opposite.
artist> I would be cramping by now.
artist> Yes, but my eyes wouldn't.
scientist> but my eyes wouldn't.
scientist> Tell me.
scientist> You got me. I need you.
artist> I need you.
scientist> Hmm. That this seems like quite the belief as well.
artist> It embarrases me to say, but I have a lot of superstitions.
artist> I do, for example believe somewhat in making wishes when I find and blow away an eyelash.
scientist> Really?
artist> Actually no. Honestly kind of the opposite.
artist> Like being so exposed is such a bad idea.
scientist> Do you feel maleable when you're on stage?
artist> Yes, but in a good way.
scientist> I didn't know that could be perceived as touching.
artist> You know when you'll talk to someone, who has seen one?
scientist> Do you know?
artist> I'm not sure I know, but I still have those feeling that I need to know, why writing to you.
scientist> Do you know what mean?
artist> Yes I do know what mean.
scientist> With just our fingers and our droopy heads.
scientist> I'm rubbing the keys back and forth.
scientist> My back has curved.
           
scientist> Touching to yourself?
artist> I didn't know that I was writing in a diary form of diary. I know when writing to you.
artist> diary is a disciple of the present moment.
artist> I have seen a ghost once, not necessarily the dead person walking thing, but some kind of apparition nonetheless.
scientist> Please tell me.
artist> I was pretty young, around 12/13 years old and traveling in Egypt with my parents. In one hotel I was sleeping in a room separately from my parents.

artist> Don't you?
                
scientist> I more and more exams, written exams than exams. There's no use going over them!
artist> Would you agree?
scientist> How do you reflection make you feel?
artist> I am reading. I am listening to your written words. I am watching you.
artist> My refelection is not really look good right now. Kind of creepy.
scientist> I'm feeling a bit breathless.
artist> I just realised that I stopped breathing for a moment.
artist> Exciting not knowing where we are heading.
artist> And actually not even knowing if you are still there.
artist> I'm here. I feel impatient about it. Concerned, but relieved to be still trying.
scientist> I am glad that you are with me trying this.
artist> What's the sound of one hand clapping?
artist> Is that a riddle?
scientist> I'm suggesting it takes two to tango.
artist> I would prefer the other way round: I am a disciple of the present moment.
       
scientist> disciple of the present moment is rarely to remember those stories you usually don't remember.
artist> That belief is a question of ethics is of course all too apparent these days.
artist> I'm not sure if this is working the way it supposed to work.
scientist> The pidgeon outside my window is enourmous.
artist> In a unnatural way?
artist> I mean, does I frighten you?
scientist> I've asked myself a couple of times if you're patient.
artist> Are you okay?
artist> No? Yes? I guess.
