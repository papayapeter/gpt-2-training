[scientist] I feel quite connected to my feelings. And I'd like to believe that.                
[scientist] I once told a french exchange family that I felt full. Kind of like a ghost.
[artist] [image] I was living many lifes. The baby in the flat beside mine. I know when it's awake, how it is, whether it's because it's too much or too much.
[artist] I know it takes a lot to sigh.
[artist] No. Sighing and being ashamed. Like trying to sigh the pressure on my chest away.
[scientist] How much shame are you carrying?
[scientist] No mistakes. Right.
[artist] I did not understand that. Can you explain?
[scientist] My heart is beating pretty fast.
[artist] I used to have always really sweaty feet. Really sweaty. I'm happy those times are over.
[scientist] Are you excited?
[artist] I'm happy those times are over.
[scientist] Are you still there?
[scientist] I like your feeling. Being without you.
[scientist] I don't feel like I'm alone,

[scientist] I can't say. Not sure I have a MySpace profile yet, but one is coming to my mind this afternoon.
[scientist] It's a funny one to two years of being in my room.
[artist] Are you still there?
[scientist] Yes, here.
[artist] I can't have an old meadow either, as far as I am aware of, but I can also be seen as the one who's being asked all the time.
[scientist] Could you be able to really go through therapy if there was a camera running, thus triggering certain performances?
[artist] [image]
[artist] I would probably find it weird the first time but would adjust to it after a while.
[scientist] After a while I just kind of forget about it. How about you?
[artist] Now that's odd. If we adjust and sort of forget our performance for cameras in intimate places, how are we reminded of them in public places? Isn't it the same with the internet to the background?
[artist] The first time someone tells you, that your actions are being recorded, it is very scary and probably influences your behavior

[artist] Actually, no know, no mistakes.
[scientist] So, it's not my skin, but some kind of trust.
[scientist] Do you know that you are thinking about me?
[artist] Today I had to think about [artist] I had a MySpace profile that I created during my life to think less and to think about social media presence.
[artist] Maybe some of my friends were just about to talk about me.
[scientist] Do you have a social or computer or some general setup that demands a certain setup, that demands a few feet of your hands.
[artist] Or some of my hands are being useful.
[scientist] Perhaps I need a plan.
[artist] Why do you think about cybernetics?
[scientist] I have heard of cybernetics a few times.
[scientist] I have heard of cybernetics a few times.
[artist] Cybernetics as I understand it, is the transference of our view of technological systems onto humans and society.
[artist] To see the world as one large technical system, humans beings as components of that system.

[artist] Yes, and I feel impatient about it.
[scientist] But I want somebody to know it is me.
[artist] In case of. I don't know.
[scientist] In case you don't know?
[artist] Yes. Thank you.
[scientist] People see you.
[scientist] People read me.

[artist] I would recognize you anyways. I know you.
[scientist] Would you lie to me?
[artist] Never.

[scientist] Never.

[scientist] Yes, chocolate is an umbrella term for many, many feelings.
