scientist> Are you still there?
artist> 

artist> I would say none. But then it haunts me in weird moments.
scientist> No mistakes. Right.
artist> I did not understand that. Can you explain?
scientist> With my legs crossed in quite a confident pose, I am actually uncertain. Soon I'll have to change position or I'll get pins and needles. You?
artist> Yeah, then better change it!
artist> I am a bit tired. I should move a bit, too. My head feels numb.
artist> Is it typing and waiting and having a silent conversation all inside your head with someone creating that numb sensation? I think I know what you mean.
artist> I don't know. I just noticed this feeling in my head. I feel it. Haven't figured out yet where it is.
artist> Do you think I should know what this will be like in the end?
scientist> No! No expectations.
scientist> It is called "Re-Engineering Humanity" by Frischmann and Selinger.
scientist> They try to build the case that we rely more and more on capacity-outsourcing technology, thus leaving us ever more dependent on (and thus conforming to) technological design choices.
artist> That sounds familiar.
scientist> However, I am also so sure about it.
artist> I do believe in the very fact that I have seen one (or one of them me).
scientist> But I would be quite sure about it.
artist> I don't have any reason to believe in ghosts.
artist> Don't you?

scientist> I feel relieved by your relating to my anxieties.
artist> How do you feel about our project?
scientist> The music is going to be distracting. My neghbour is listening to... ah now its quiter.
scientist> It was coming through the wall a minute ago.
artist> I can hear different things outside.
artist> Anything too ordinary! I was ordinary!
artist> Yes.
scientist> I don't want to tell you what to do. I need to be to the time.
scientist> To do what feels right.
artist> I'm sitting with my legs crossed in quite a confident pose, though I'm actually uncertain. Soon I'll have to change position or I'll get pins and needles. You?
artist> Yeah, then better change it!
artist> I am a bit tired. I should move a bit, too. My head feels numb.
artist> Is it typing and waiting and having a silent conversation all inside your head with someone creating that numb sensation? I think I know what you mean.
artist> I don't know. I just noticed this feeling in my head. I feel it. Haven't figured out yet where it's coming from yet.
artist> Do you think I should know what this will be like in the end?

artist> That sounds familiar.
scientist> Or are you just a pair of hands. I might be. With a brain. Fingers and a brain. Or just a brain.
scientist> They're the only bits of me you need.
artist> Are you still there?
scientist> 
   
artist> I am proud of my work sometimes.
scientist> I'm in a new room.
artist> Does that change something between us?
artist> Are you still there?
scientist> 

artist> I am here. I feel impatient about it. Concerned, but relieved to be still trying.
artist> I am glad that you are with me trying this.
artist> What's the sound of one hand clapping?
artist> Is that a riddle?
scientist> I'm suggesting it takes two to tango.
artist> Well here we are.

scientist> Can you describe that privacy.
artist> Productivity isn't flirting with me anymore.
 
artist> I am flirting with you. I want to.
scientist> I was flirting with excitement when I started. Maybe with you, too.
artist> And are you stil flirting with anything right now.
scientist> flirting with the idea of being finished.
scientist> Good to get that out. Now I feel like starting again.
scientist> Or maybe I felt I shouldn't have said that. Maybe I still feel like finishing.
artist> Starting and ending and while ending feeling it all could start again.
artist> 
            
scientist> I'm here. I feel impatient about it. Concerned, but relieved to be still trying.
artist> I am glad that you are with me trying this.
