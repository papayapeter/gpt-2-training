Dear Zeno,
I enjoy arguing (as you may be able to tell by now), and I don't think you were particularly callous. The frustration with the contexts of our lives, and audacious proposals from start-ups to offer a technological solution for what might as well be considered deeper economic and social issues, can lead to harsh reactions. And who knows - maybe this technosolutionism is indeed making things much worse down the line.

Dear Zeno,
I do like your view that psychotherapy can be a catalyst for change. And indeed, many psychologists understood themselves as social reformers, as far as I know (while of course people like Freud confused social privilege with psychological conditions, like the infamous penis envy). But I would say it is generally true, albeit hard to put into large scale: Political psychotherapy may just try to force ideologies on people rather than take their specific issue into account (even though, as you said before, these specific issues may all arise from a shared source, i.e., patriarchy, capitalism, etc.).

Dear Zeno,
I am going in circles here, so I'll turn to my lamp. I was asking about it, because for the last 4 or 5 winters I noticed that my mood changes for the wintertime, and I noticed it is mostly about the darkness. I hated it in school, when you go to school when it's dark, and you leave it when the sun sets as well, and now working from home I usually don't get to go out before the sun has set, either. I determined it's not the cold or the lack of foliage or whatever else changes for winter, but the lack of sunlight. It's also a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the moment you believe it, it is reinforced.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
The sunlight lamp, then, is at least a reliable placebo to fight this self-fulfilling prophecy (or is an actual remedy to an actual mental issue - who's to say?). I am currently working on placebos and their ethical use, which is why I might have come across this topic in my mind. Also, I use the lamp to look at some film negatives, as the clean white light makes it easy to take a closer look.

Dear Zeno,
I noticed I have two cameras at home now and assume they're from you. Do you have instructions for me how to set them up properly?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Hey Zeno,
this is an interesting take on cameras and performance, and one I had to think about. Because in my experience, many people perceive a camera is a source of discomfort rather than an empowering object to take charge of your own image. Is this maybe because identity-construction is done (and rehearsed?) in private, and not meant to be intentionally performed?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Hey Zeno,
Even more interesting for me was the fact that this reminded me of how psychotherapists are trained. Presumably, in psychotherapy one ought to let their guard down, and, if at all possible, not perform but question the reasons for certain reactions (and reactive performances). However, psychotherapists-in-training are being filmed with their patients (and of course their consent), to have their supervisors/trainers guide and guard the process. Would you be able to really go through therapy if there was a camera running, thus triggering certain performances? Or is the "taking charge"-argument of yours actually fitting this situation as well, as the way we present ourselves is (or should be) the subject of therapy?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Hey Zeno,
And, then, could be cut out the middleman and just have therapy with a camera?

Dear Zeno,
attaching to this train of thought of the previous email, I often argue with friends, two of them in particular, who claim that we have a true self. Unsurprisingly, once you believe that there is such a thing as a true self (which usually is understood as an invariable, or "core" of your personality), you are obligated to be that as often as possible. Everything else is performance, or undue social influence. Thus, you owe it to yourself to be true to yourself, (as philosophers as well as Hollywood tells us, too). The consequences of agreeing or disagreeing with the very notion of having a true, invariable, core self, then, seems rather big, and I am still wondering if there are good arguments for or against it that are not connected to practical concerns.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I know exactly what you mean with your question, and immediately had two examples in my head: one is what my brother called his "party smile", i.e., the smile he learned to put on whenever he's in a club or party and a photographer took his picture. Some other friends of mine have this smile-reflex too, it's a learned staging-when-filmed/pictured reaction. However, since I never went to parties where pictures were taken, I missed the chance on creating a party-smile. Thus, most of the pictures people take of me are uncomfortable to me, because I smile without subconsciously accounting for the picture - I always look chubbier, rounder in pictures, with my eyes almost shut from just smiling the way I would smile to convey happiness to others. I do wish more often than not that I had a party smile, tho. Ironically.

Dear Zeno,
And while I am aware of this feeling of surveillance cameras, it hits quite different. Rarely is there a surveillance camera that I don't wave into, with childish delight. The best ones, of course, are those with a small monitor showing the live feed, so you can watch yourself from a different angle. Do you do that, too? Or do you feel observed? Interrogated? Even maybe suspected of a crime? I suppose my feelings would change, too, if these cameras were ubiquitous like in the United Kingdom.

Dear Zeno,
apologies, again, for a delayed response. The last two weeks were a bit of struggle, as I hade several risk exposures to the coronavirus, while also having to attend my mother's wedding this weekend. This meant lots of testing and trying to find potential exposure concerns. Luckily, every test taken returned negative.

Dear Zeno,
I find your coordination system, in which you navigate spirituality, religion, and its institutions rather fascinating, and probably somewhat reflective of general attitudes of many younger people who do not care for any kind of institutionalized religion but still feel attracted to unknowable systems and ungroundable practices (apologies for making up the word "ungroundable" - philosophers take the liberty to form new words to denote something for what we currently have no precise enough word). One of my philosophy professors in Berlin, Volker Gerhardt, once said that never believe people more things that wasn't supported by factual knowledge than today. It sounds like a very surprising thesis, as we pride ourselves with basing most of our convictions on knowledge; however, with the expanding sphere of the known unknowns, i.e., discovering things that we just do not know anything about, we may be inclined to agree: we do believe in things we simply cannot know, or maybe only have a slim understanding of.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
To answer your question: I certainly have many beliefs that will not withstand further scrutiny; everybody does. Few of those I endorse knowing full well that they are, in fact, irrational (either in the meaning of "it hurts me to believe this" and "I do not have enough evidence to believe this"). One, however, I am quite proud of to have made a living practice: I trust people more than I should. I think people are generally trustworthy, in the literal sense: We should trust people. I think this keeps me sane, it is a happy outlook on society, and it really allows me to adjust my expectations: I trust them and think it is good to trust people, though often I am being disappointed. And yet, I try my best to still trust them. This backfires every now and then when I entrust someone with a secret; and some of my friends find me naive at times. I would have to go into detail what the difference between trust and ignorance is, as I am no stranger to know that people are, in fact, bad. I guess it is about the wish to allow yourself to remain vulnerable (and trust that this vulnerability is not being exploited), in opposite to allowing others to lie to you. I am not sure if you expected a simpler answer, though. So give me yours - do you believe in something you (or... your peers?) would consider irrational to believe?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I hope your move went well, and that your year has started in promising ways with new opportunities and ideas. I'm sure it will.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
So, of course, you are right about the things philosophers have to say about beliefs. It is in fact both historically and contemporarily one of the hot topics, as just recently we changed our analysis (or rather, the framing) of what beliefs are and what they do. We more and more believe that we have certain control over what we (sincerely) believe, which makes it a question of ethics. As you allude to the notion of conspiracy theories, not everything you believe should be believed, and we would claim that you should try to believe only true statements. However, you can believe only true statements and yet misrepresent the world. That's one challenge of fake news (at least some fake news sources don't outright lie, but rather omit important context to influence you), and potentially of some supernatural systems, too. Thus, the next rule would be that we should not only believe true statements (and try to reduce the number of false statements in what we take to be true), but also that we should aim for only searching for reliable sources. Thus, not only the statements themselves but also the source of them should be of a certain truth-oriented quality.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
And this leads me to ghosts. As I said before, I am not generally opposed to the idea of ghosts existing, but rather that I have yet to see a theory that integrates them into my other beliefs that I hold to be true. And that kind of is the challenge, especially with these "epistemic virtues" to believe true statements and seek true-statement-producing sources.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I had not heard from hauntology before, and a quick google search has not brought more insight than a simple wikipedia defintion. Are you more familiar with it? And do you find the ideas in there helpful (and would care to share them here?)?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
In any event, looking forward to hearing from you.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
you have a point. Any approach to a theory of identity should answer more questions than what Plato does here. I suppose, especially with personal identity, our own perceptions and self-narratives and stories are the more relevant pieces that make for what we call a "self." I never figured out how to tell a coherent story about myself online, even though I mentioned me being a philosopher in one or two Instagram posts, which I suppose is partly correct, but also kind of show-off-ish, and borderline elitist (because what are the most common associations with "being a philosopher"? I suppose I wanted to evoke those...). Come to think of it, I might have been most coherent on online-dating profiles.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
This got me thinking, however, on how we in the end create our own identity online. We tell stories to give others an impression of who we are. And it is common wisdom now to reject most of those stories as curated, selective, or even manipulative. So, I wonder, what kind of identity do we create online? Is it even possible to share "authentic" identities? After all, everything I post (and everything I do not post) is curated, selective, and potentially manipulative. I am not sure I have an answer here. Do you know someone that has an authentic online presence?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
thank you for your email and apologies for the belated reply. Your message made me think about several of those now-defunct social media accounts, but even more so how those still have reverberations throughout my life to this day. Some friends I made on an online forum for computer games are still around, while I have long stopped playing video games. For a while, more people knew me under my pseudonym (the name of an old pharao) than my real name.

Dear Zeno,
Maybe it's time to take some of these old pieces of software out again to revisit how they have aged. Are you still making music, and is there a connection from the Zeno that is frozen in time in those accounts? Or have you changed, and moved on?
Regards from afar,

Dear Zeno,
do you have an important piece of furniture, or interior design element, or some general setup, that makes your apartment more like a home? I've been in the (very slow) process of redecorating my apartment, and I always wonder if, next to the necessities, some of these elements (couch, bed, desk, table?) I should prioritize.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I suppose the ethics of believing in ghosts are rather neutral in themselves, as it depends on several supporting factors - especially in combination with your excellent point on faiths being unprovable as well: If you believe in ghosts, you ought to be able to explain what that means for your worldview, and I suppose that will stand in conflict with what you (supposedly) also believe. Thus, the ethics of beliefs regarding anything spiritual are about the general framework of how these beliefs are integrated into other sets of rational statements.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
"Enlightened theology", thus, is the attempt to combine those two frameworks as not in conflict but in harmony (or, maybe, claim them to be fully disjunct?). Especially Christianity (Both the Catholic and the Protestant flavors) have strong advocates for this view (Thomas Aquinus in the Middle Ages made some early attempts at this, and Friedrich Schleiermacher has some prominence in claiming that science and Christianity should not oppose each other here in Berlin in the 19th century): Faith and scientific belief ought to be in harmony (also a reason why the Catholic Church largely accepts Darwinism (at least since John Paul II.)). I think a "rational theology of ghosts" is possible, i.e., it proposes no statements that are in conflicts with science (or can be refuted at some point), and I suppose using competing concepts like angels is a way of going mainstream-Christian ways (Jewish enlightenment has these tools as well, thanks to people like Spinoza, Moses Mendelssohn, Abraham Geiger and Hermann Cohen).
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Now, turning towards Hauntology as a concept (as far as I understand it right now) - this seems to be a way, indeed, of taking the risky, pop-cultural elements out of it. However, the "agents", i.e., the things that do something without being there, might be less personal/agential and more conceptual. The fact, then, that concepts pervade our norms, actions, and beliefs, is not very surprising. However, I am sure Derrida - or you - have stronger arguments to make down the line.
Best from afar,

Dear Zeno,
have you heard of the philosophical metaphor of the ship of Theseus? It's a story originally told by Plato to make a point about identity - Theseus is on a long voyage on his ship. Eventually, during this voyage, every single plank of this ship has to be replaced by a new piece due to corrosion damage. At the end of the voyage, the ship is been completely replaced in its elements but is still being referred to as the same as at the beginning of the voyage. It appears identity is connected to certain features related to persistence in time. Now, would you say that you are the same person as the Zeno known by the (however small) group of people enjoying his music? Or is that a person which is long gone, replaced by an "update" to also get rid of personal bugs, viruses, and unused skill?
Regards from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Regarding your question about how my relationships developed: most people I met back then and am still in contact with have become part of my social circle with some physical presence. However, many of my friendships made in-person over the last few years have major digital elements to them, as they live far away or so. Makes me wonder how the physical presence in friendships counts for those relationships in the first place.
Regards from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I am not sure. I agree with the notion that an online presence is more intentional, and thereby there are more opportunities to "create" a presence that's less authentic. Yet, as you also ask, what even is authenticity? If all my friends were to meet each other at a party, I am not convinced they would recognize the same Hendrik. With some people, I am more witty, political, and earnest. With others, I am more silly. With others yet again, I am softer and understanding, depending on mood, chemistry, and the general vibe.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I don't fake any of these interactions, yet I can imagine some of my friends being surprised to see these "sides" of me they usually don't see - couldn't that also be a dimension of an online presence? Just another side of me?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Either way, I am not sure myself. I do have a hard time believing that people dancing to trendy songs is exposing one of their sides they would not show other people. However - many younger people are sharing accounts and performances with friends. How does that even work in thinking about authenticity? Maybe several people are faking it together?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
yes - from the safety of my computer screen and with enough time on my hands to carefully lay out my argument, and without having to get personal, arguing is fun (or rather, in these conditions, arguing is my job...).
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
With that in mind, I am prepared to argue over ghosts, too. But first, to answer your question in the least useful way possible: I don't think I have seen a ghost like you may have. This is because I am somewhat unclear of what a ghost is, or what phenomena should (still) count as ghosts. The more rigid the definition, the less likely I'll agree to have seen one: if it must be an actual dead person's spirit lingering, I have no reason to believe that I have seen one (or that anyone has seen one). If its more of a weirdly personal apparition that cannot be explained, then I'll believe others have seen one (but not me). And if it's more of a surprising/spontaneous feeling of connection to someone long gone "as if they were there", then I can say that I have. Seeing old pictures of someone with yourself in it without remembering that moment yourself feels like seeing a "ghost", as it's a gap in your own stream of consciousness but remembered by technology.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
So, I have not seen what counts culturally as a ghost (Scooby-doo-style), but I believe when others have this deeply unsettling feeling of having had some kind of contact with someone. But, of course, I have to ask: have you? What do you take to be a ghost, and have you seen one according to that idea?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Lastly, on photography (to keep the balancing act between two largely (but not completely) unrelated topics): yes! I still take analog photographs. When I started, digital photography was in its infancy, and my mom first gave me a Nikon F-301 to play with. Around my 18th birthday I bought a Hasselblad 500c/m and have been stuck with medium format ever since (but also only occasionally because good film and development is a pricey hobby). But now with a stable job and some better equipment I can actually revisit this hobby more regularly. Do you use photography as a medium to express yourself, too?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I do disagree with your sentiment about more accessible psychotherapy, even though I agree with the diagnosis behind it. I think you are correct about the fact that our current system (or maybe, elements of it) are making people sick. Whether this is worsening or maybe merely shifting from one issue to another, I dare not judge. I don't think a 45h-work week of a factory worker from 120 years ago was especially healthy mentally either; or being a disenfranchised woman not being taken seriously in her opinions or ailments; or being a child regularly beaten by their parents. Our current system makes us sick, but were we less sick before?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
If I am correct (at least in my doubt), and we were not healthier but just sick in a different way, making help more accessible cannot be a concern but must be an obligation (which refocuses the question back to whether AI is actually the solution here, or potentially exploitative). We now have the theories and technology to help people more readily, sustainably, and accurately. Might as well use it.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
The other reason why I do not share the concern of improved healthcare being a rat race is that this argument only looks at the collective level. Even if it was true that our current system was making us sicker, and expanded access to healthcare merely cements the status quo, how would you tell that to someone who is burned out and suicidal? This reminds me a bit of the immiseration theory, which has often been taken by Marxists to push against their own normative claims: Capitalism as the cause for the immiseration of workers can only be overcome by making workers even worse until they revolt and revolutionize the system. Taken seriously, some Marxists have advocated torturing the working class even more, because if the help came from the capitalists (or even just reformers like Social Democrats), their necessary fervor to revolutionize would be dampened. One could say: Dry timber burns the hottest.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Analogously, not only is capitalism the source of many mental health issues, but we also have to deny ourselves help to be even worse so we develop the urge to change things. If we get all a little psychotherapy, we would just feel "good enough" to remain in the system, and potentially write thank-you letters to our bosses who provide mental health while being the very reason we need health care in the first place.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I am not sure if you actually want to say this, and I apologize if I mischaracterized your view. However, these styles of arguments are not uncommon when people attempt to change a system and I've seen different areas of concern where this is applied to, while always feeling weirdly surprised that the individual suffering is erased in this.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Ultimately, I don't see how both things cannot be true at the same time: the awareness that the system is the cause of your constant feeling of exhaustion, anxiety, depression, or anger, and the awareness that you need help and should get it as easy and fast as you can.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Apologies for having gone off-track here, I really felt phrasing my own concerns in a more expanded way would help clarify things for myself.
Best from afar,

Dear Zeno,
To add to a related but new point: I use a sunlight lamp, imitating sunshine in these rather dark weeks of the year. Have you ever used one?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
after I asked for what reason you used (analog) photography, I was wondering myself if it is even a particularly expressive medium. I suppose less than others - since most categories of photography require the expression of subjects as well, which you may capture and thus merely "document". Yet, one certainly can be artistic with analog photography, and isn't artistry the locus of expression? In any event - keeping memories with analog film seems like an absolutely worthwhile use of this technology.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Okay, let's talk about ghosts. I don't suppose I have any reason to believe in them. I do believe in the very fact that people are convinced that they saw one (like your apparition in Egypt). So, philosophically speaking, I accept that from an epistemic perspective, people have reason to defend this belief. That is because epistemically speaking, your perception and impression of your perception is not implausible: you can specifically recall the experience, it's an experience as 'real' as any other experience one might have.
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
However. The claims (or maybe rather even "propositions") made when taking these perceptions seriously require the world to be of a certain way: The world in its nature, i.e., in its innate structure, has to be able to "host" these ghosts, if we were not to claim that you were just making things up. You require a certain ontology, i.e., a certain kind of structure to constitute existence at large. And that is a rather heavy consequence from seeing an apparition in a doorway. Now, you can say (and with you a good third of the history of philosophy) that we only understand our world's internal structure precisely because of our perceptions. Thus, seeing ghosts very much necessitates that our theory of the nature of the world can in fact host ghosts. After all, why would we trust our senses when coming up with a theory of color, but not when coming up with a theory of ghosts?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
I suppose what keeps me from endorsing ghosts is that I have yet to encounter a theory of ghosts that is plausible. I think Native American approaches of not locating ghosts into a parallel world but rather considering them very much part of this world is a better way to grapple with these phenomena than the typical Western idea of dead humans occasionally floating about in this world while normally waiting in the "otherworld" or in the "big beyond". With the former, Native American theory (also common with many other cultures of course), we may even be able to catch these apparitions on film indeed. What is your theory of ghosts, if you believe that you see them? Can you make sense of what you see?
Best from afar,
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
now - that's odd. If we adjust and sort of forget our performance for cameras in intimate places, how are we reminded of them in public places? Is there a way of not being "used to" public cameras the way we are getting used to therapy ones? I must admit, I don't actually know. The one I forget, the other one I do not. Yet, the one I forget is the one where I am making myself vulnerable, while the other one is the one where I am merely shopping. For the one I could be judged for some of my deepest desires and worst thoughts and I am sincere; for the other I am just buying milk, yet I display a performance to keep me "hidden in plain sight".

Dear Zeno,
You asked about my thoughts on therapy apps. I can only endorse them at this point. The merely technologically mediated human-human therapy, at least, should not be a problem ("should" both in the meaning of "I don't expect it to be a problem"; and "I don't think we should worry about it"). The point of therapists, as far as my own experience and knowledge go, is rarely to be personally present. Therapists guide thought processes, observe, assist, and initiate reevaluations. They explicitly are not their own self in those sessions, as they are not allowed to judge (as to not discourage their patient to keep things hidden). Thus, if people prefer talking via video chat or phone, I think there's nothing wrong with it. Instead, it probably allows people to access these services for the first time, thus expanding healthcare to those who need it (which, I suppose, is most people).
Best from afar (for real this time),
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
Transferred to potential AI: I do think that AI can really cover a need here. For sure, some people will never accept a non-feeling AI to guide therapy, but there has been some research out that suggests some people preferring the non-judgmental reactions of an AI over knowing that a human will always react a certain way. I can help people to admit otherwise morally disastrous personal traits - lust for murder and aggression, sexual perversions, trauma, etc.
Best from afar (for real this time),
Hendrik


Dear Zeno,
The dangers, on the other hand, are obvious and must be addressed in some form or another before any AI-therapists should be allowed: both that AI should not be the standard (i.e., that people cannot access human therapists anymore), and that some AI-therapies may experience a certain "dehumanizing" factor. The lack of common sense in AI is currently way too big a problem to let people replace therapists with chatbots. But, fundamentally, I am hopeful that we may help more people with this.
Best from afar (for real this time),

Dear Zeno,
Yet, without writing too much right now, I am also rather curious about what you think! Lastly, apologies for the belated reply - I taught in person for the first time this week, meaning I had to travel through Germany to teach five tired students in person for 90min. I did worse for less, but not by much.
