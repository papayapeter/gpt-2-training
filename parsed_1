Hi Hendrik,
I have heard of this story, yes. To me though it seems somewhat beside the point, to be honest (it is a funny one to think about though). But beware, I am a bit of a novice, when it comes to philosophy. I would say that we construct identity mostly through stories (or history). This can be empowering in some cases but restricting in others. I can, for instance, claim my history and construct my story, but I can also be seen as the stories that are being “told” about me or, even worse, see myself this way. I hope that makes sense.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Plato should have known this by the way, what else did he do with Socrates? The question if this was the real Socrates doesn’t seem to be that important. On social networks, you construct identity through stories also.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
What is your story (or one of them anyway)?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
that is interesting! I don't have a party smile either, as far as I  am aware of, but I do have a preoccupation with staging and  authenticity. That probably has to do with the fact that I don't really  care about catching a smile, when I take a photograph, but I do care  about composition (and authenticity, whatever that is now).
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I heavily dislike surveillance cameras as a strong symbol of power,  but I really like your reaction to it. To me it seems like a really nice  and nonviolent of signalling: "I see you, I know that you are here".
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
As a matter of fact this is kind of what I wanted to get at in my  last mail: I think, as soon as we perform in front of a camera, we take  charge of our image. I would consider it an empowering act. I don't  usually perform in front of security cameras. Neither do I while  browsing online. Maybe I should behave similarly to being in front of a  film camera though. Take charge of my representation. Say "I see you, I  know that you see me".
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
first of all, that was quite some time it took for me to answer. I  didn't miss your mail, in case you were wondering, I was just moving  flats and had very little time and then I went on holiday for a bit. I  am glad to get back to corresponding with you though and I hope you are  doing well.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I find your (philosophical) perspective on ghosts very interesting. I  could not make sense of what I saw exactly and I don't have a theory on  apparitions myself. It is not even so much that I believed what I saw  was a ghost, it is more that I wanted to believe if you know what I  mean. It is something so wondrous, frightening and exciting to believe  that there was actually something there. Of course I believe a lot of  philosophers would have quite something to say about someone, who  chooses to believe in something, for which there is no rational or  factual basis, even though he knows it probably isn't true (that is,  after all, not so far off from conspiracy theories one could say).
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
One philosophical concept that is somewhat related to ghosts however is  hauntology. Are you familiar with it?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
No worries, it is nice to read from you! No, I am not making music  anymore and yes, there might still be some connection left. I wanted to  listen to the music that I made as a teenager some years ago, but it  must have gotten lost one of those times, that I reinstalled my  operating system. I do this about every one to two years, because I feel  like there is so much stuff on my computer accumulating in the  background. Viruses, temporary data, weird files left behind by long  uninstalled programs.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Anyway, in the end I couldn’t find the music on my computer, so I looked  for my old profile online, but I had forgotten the name and the  platform. Who knows, I might have a niche fanbase out there and I  wouldn’t even know about it (to be fair, that is highly unlikely).
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
my move went well, thank you. It's slowly becoming homely in my new place.
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
That belief is a question of ethics is of course all too apparent these  days. I wonder though, if what you write implies, that a belief in  ghosts (especially an unquestioning one) is unethical, as long as such a  theory, that integrates them well has been forwarded or found.
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Isn't it a big part of belief, especially religious or spiritual belief,  that that which is believed in, cannot be proven?
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
To be honest, I don't really know exactly, what hauntology is. I have  never read Derrida much and it comes from him. I just know the  interpretation by Mark Fisher, which goes something like this: Hauntoloy  is the concept of something acting without (physically) existing. This  could be something that is already gone, but still has an impact on the  world and people today (e.g. national socialism) or something that has  not yet arrived, but is somehow foreshadowed.
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
It' just an interesting way of thinking for me. As an example: I  recently saw a clip if a comedian at carnival in Germany in the 70s  manipulating a crowd into answering his "sieg" with "heil", by getting  them to shout and answer without thinking first. If national socialism  is seen as some kind of an evil specter hanging around, then this  comedian (I think hos name was Jonny Buchardt) could be seen as a  conjurer. I hope I didn't make a mess of explaining this.
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I wouldn't really say that I use photography to express myself (at least  artistically), but I do like taking analog photos as well. Mostly for  memories though. Of friends, of vacations or of parties. I have a F-301  as well and a Nikon FE2, but a Hasselblad is of course quite something else.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I think I have seen a ghost once, not necessarily the dead person  walking thing, but some kind of apparition nonetheless. I was pretty  young, around 12/13 years old and traveling in Egypt with my parents. In  one hotel I was sleeping in a room separately from my parents. At night  I woke up and saw somebody white (I think a wholly white woman) standing  in the doorway. At first I thought it was my mother in an eerie light,  but when I said her name, the figure didn't answer. I was afraid to get  up and have a closer look and fell asleep again after a while. I have to  say, for honesty's sake, that I'm pretty short sighted, so it might just  have been a trick of the light, but I didn't think so back then.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Even more interestingly, when I told this story to some friends on an  art school excursion, two of them had their own story about seeing  actual ghosts or apparitions.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I find it interesting that you draw a connection between between ghosts  and photography. There seems to be something to that. I know that when  photography was invented, some people believed that you might be able to  capture ghosts on film. Now I have an even trickier question. Do you  believe in ghosts?
Zeno


Hi Hednrik,
thank your for writing this and indeed for "going off-track", which I  wouldn't even say that you did. Your points make a lot of sense and what  you wrote shows me that I have been wrong in my perspective or at least  very short sighted. I am sorry for being so callous.
What do they do for you?
Zeno


Hi Hednrik,
Indeed I could myself never say that there should be less psychotherapy  in the world, as I myself, have benefited extremely from it. Talking  about individual suffering: I had extreme anxiety issues as a late  teenager that almost prevented me from leaving the house for a year or  so. If somebody would have told me then: 'What are you getting therapy  for, change the system instead!' it would have been very unhelpful to  say the least. And other people have and had it much worse of course. So  no, I do not want anybody to suffer, neither for nor against "the system".
What do they do for you?
Zeno


Hi Hednrik,
And, as you rightly pointed out, while conditions now might make us  sick, they weren't necessarily healthy in the past.
What do they do for you?
Zeno


Hi Hednrik,
I think my frustration comes from the the fact that psychotherapy had a  huge potential for larger scale transformation to a healthier state of  society, at least some practitioners of it thought so. This is in  someways analogous to the internet in the 90s (I hope that I am not  going far off-track now). And I am afraid that apps could lead to a  monopolization of mental health care and might not be designed to "cure"  (i.e. to help them improve their mental health to a point at which they  don't need the app anymore) but to keep their users in a state of  dependence (because that is where the profit is). Much like the state of  large parts of the internet nowadays.
What do they do for you?
Zeno


Hi Hednrik,
So the only thing I would keep standing from my previous arguments is:  What would the motives of the makers of the app be? The rest you have  rightly done away with.
What do they do for you?
Zeno


Hi Hednrik,
And no I have never used a sunshine lamp. I do consume large quantities  of vitamin D in the winter though. I have heard that lamps like these  can help with seasonal depression, but as I have just written, my  problem tends to be more anxiety rather than depression.
What do they do for you?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I think it is rather impossible to have an "authentic" online presence.  Contrary to how we may phrase it, one cannot "be" online, right? The  only thing users can do is leave traces that reference their existence  and those are, like most stories I think, grounded in truth somewhere,  but certainly not "the truth".
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Look at us though, throwing big words around like "truth" and  "authenticity". I don't even really know what that means.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
today I had to think about all those social media profiles of mine that  are still floating around the network somewhere, forgotten. Actually,  now that I think about it, I may really have forgotten some of them.  Maybe some of them have been been shut down by now, but maybe some of  them are still being kept alive (or rather in a catatonic state) by some  obscure company still paying the bills. Like my MySpace profile for  example that I created during my fleeting ambition as a teenager to  become an electronic musician.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
How about you, have you been using social media a lot in your life?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
so those friends that you made online back in the day, are friends that  you meet in person now or did those friendships remain in the virtual?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
what you wrote makes me realize that we didn't talk about one thing yet,  the adjustment to observation. If I was being filmed during therapy, I  would probably find it weird the first time but would adjust to it after  a while. After a certain period of time, I would probably just kind of  forget it. How about you?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Isn't it the same with the internet to some degree. The first time  someone tells you, that your actions are being recorded, it is very  scary and probably influences your behavior, after a while though this  feeling moves to the background.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Incidentally, what do you think about (ai driven) therapy apps?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I am sure Derrida has or had (unless he is still with us) quite more to  say on the subject. I don't at the moment. I am however in the lucky  position of not having to explain myself too much. As I said, for me it  is more of a mind game right now.
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
It is interesting what you are saying about religion. A small part of me  somehow thinks that trying to kind of unite spirituality and science  takes the flavor out of religion. I mean let's face it: If the church  wasn't so worried about losing their sheep, they might take a more  radical stance. Then I remember that I am actually not such a huge fan  of the church personally and that I would very much prefer "enlightened"  religions to more radical alternatives.
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
As for furniture, I really like a good table, but I have just built  myself a couch of which I am very proud. I feel like a good and  comfortable sofa is a very versatile piece of furniture. You can use it  for reading, taking naps and its good when you have friends over. What  does my priority in furniture say about me though?
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I remember a friend of mine telling me about dates he had (especially  concerning architects): "Their desks were always lager than their beds.  That is all I'm going to say".
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Is there something you believe in that you would consider irrational?
Rgds,
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I know exactly what you mean. I remember distinctly when an old relation  of mine accused me of being not real, after we went out with some of my  friends. She saw me acting differently with those people than she was  used to me behaving when I was alone with her. I couldn't convince her,  though that I was not faking or pretending.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
The word that comes to my mind, when I think about social media presence  is "staging" or "presentation" which somehow feels distinct from  "authentic behavior" though I could honestly not say why.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Have you ever had the experience that you realized you were being filmed  or photographed and you suddenly had the feeling of performing, that you  didn't know how to act authentically anymore? If you know this feeling,  do you feel the same way with surveillance cameras?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I can tell that you enjoy arguing an I have great respect towards it! I  do have to say that I'm not used to it, but I would like to become so.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
Do you practice analog photography then, if you use your sunlamp for  viewing negatives? I can relate to your reasons for owning a sunlamp. I  used to hate it as a child to, to get out in the morning when I was  tired and cold and it was dark (weirdly I really enjoy getting up before  dawn for traveling though, as it somehow always makes it seem like an  adventure). And if you have found yourself a placebo that is consistent  in its effectiveness, doesn't that almost make it an actual remedy. I  have the impression that in mental health, the lines between placebo and  "medicine" are blurry.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
If you're up for it, I would also like to do a 180 topic wise and talk  to you about something a little different: ghosts. Have you ever seen one?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
don't worry about answering late. It seems that the way in which  teaching moved to digital space over the past year and a half did have  its advantages as well.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
I do not really know what to think about machine therapists to be  honest. I share many of your thoughts. For example I agree that it might  be a good way to make mental health care accessible to more people. yet  some eeriness remains for me. This has little to do with the usage of ai  in this case. It comes down to two things for me. First of all I feel  that psychotherapy can very much be part of the rat race, if you know  what I mean.
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
As far as I know, mental health issues are becoming much more prolific.  It might be that we always had the same level of mental health issues in  our society, as we have now, it just wasn't visible, because of stigma,  etc. That certainly plays a part, but I think that our system is also  increasingly making people sick (this is very polemic, I know). In that  case though, widely available mental health care might just enable  people to continue being able to bear the unhealthy life that they are  driven to live in a system that demands 110% productivity and  increasingly dumps all responsibility on the individual. This would work  better with an app that with people therapist, who are much less  predictable. Endemic mental health issues don't need medicine, they need  change. What would the motives of the makers of the app be?
Zeno


Hi Hendrik,
On the other hand, I think that if therapy moves to the digital space,  it would set the aforementioned camera firmly in the therapy space. What do you think? Do you disagree with my sentiment?
Zeno
